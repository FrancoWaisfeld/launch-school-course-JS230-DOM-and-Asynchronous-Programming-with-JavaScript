# Launch School Course JS230 DOM and Asynchronous Programming with JavaScript

This repository contains practice exercises and projects from Launch School's JS230 course.

## What I learned in this course:

- The DOM and how it lets developers change a document
- How to update the UI in response to actions triggered by the user or the browser
- XMLHttpRequest, one of the browser APIs that provide network programming functionality to JavaScript applications.
- asynchronous JavaScript
- how to leverage third party libraries, such as jQuery, to simplify certain aspects of front-end development

## Projects from this course

- **guess-a-word**: a word guessing game similar to hang-man built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- **photo_gallery2**: a photo gallery application with likes, favorites, and comments built using vanilla JavaScript, Handlebars.js, Express.js, HTML, and CSS.
